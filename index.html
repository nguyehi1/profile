                <p>
                  Lisbon is Portugal’s hilly, coastal capital city. From imposing São Jorge Castle,
                  the view encompasses the old city’s pastel-colored buildings, Tagus Estuary and
                  Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge. Nearby, the National Azulejo Museum displays
                  5 centuries of decorative ceramic tiles. Just outside Lisbon is a string of
                  Atlantic beaches, from Cascais to Estoril.

              <p>Porto is a coastal city in northwest Portugal known for its stately
                bridges and port wine production. In the medieval Ribeira (riverside)
                district, narrow cobbled streets wind past merchants’ houses and cafes.
                São Francisco Church is known for its lavish baroque interior with ornate
                gilded carvings. The palatial 19th-century Palácio de Bolsa, formerly a
                stock market, was built to impress potential European investors..</p></td>

              <p>Amsterdam is the Netherlands’ capital, known for its artistic heritage,
                elaborate canal system and narrow houses with gabled facades, legacies
                of the city’s 17th-century Golden Age. Its Museum District houses the
                Van Gogh Museum, works by Rembrandt and Vermeer at the Rijksmuseum, and
                modern art at the Stedelijk. Cycling is key to the city’s character,
                and there are numerous bike paths</p>
